# Message Handlers

## Logging handler

Ever wanted to see what's happening under the hood of calls with the HttpClient? Simply add a logging handler to see what's going on.

TODO: sample code

##  Bearer authentication

##  Bearer authentication with Refit

##  Add parameters to query string

This handler can be used to add custom parameters to every call. I used it to add a security token to every call without having to specify it everywhere in my code.
